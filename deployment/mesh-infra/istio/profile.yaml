# Copied from:
# - https://github.com/istio/istio/blob/1.11.4/manifests/profiles/demo.yaml
#
# Changed:
# - added nodePort 80 and 443 to make the ingress gateway accept external
#   HTTP and HTTPS traffic from those ports, since we're not using an
#   external load balancer.
# - added extensionProviders stanza to be able to delegate security
#   decisions to OPA through a custom authorisation policy, see
#   * https://istio.io/latest/blog/2021/better-external-authz/
#   NOTE. With this setup, Envoy calls an OPA service in the cluster.
#   It's also possible (advisable actually!) to run an OPA process as
#   an additional sidecar so you never pay the price of a network call
#   to check security policies.
